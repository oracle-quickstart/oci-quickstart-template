# oci-quickstart-template

The [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Quick Start](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart?q=oci-quickstart) is a collection of examples that allow Oracle Cloud Infrastructure users to get a quick start deploying advanced infrastructure on OCI.

The oci-quickstart-template repository contains the template that can be used for accelerating the construction of quickstarts that runs from local Terraform CLI, [OCI Resource Manager](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm) and [OCI Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cloudshellintro.htm).

Simple is a sample quickstart terraform template that deploys a virtual machine on a Virtual Cloud Network.
Simple can be customized to subscribe and launch Marketplace images, Platform images or Custom images.

This repo is under active development.  Building open source software is a community effort.  We're excited to engage with the community building this.

## Resource Manager Deployment

This Quick Start uses [OCI Resource Manager](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm) to make deployment easy, sign up for an [OCI account](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit) if you don't have one, and just click the button below:

[![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg)](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?region=home&zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-quickstart-template/archive/master.zip)

After logging into the console you'll be taken through the same steps described
in the [Deploy](#deploy) section below.


Note, if you use this template to create another repo you'll need to change the link for the button to point at your repo.

## Local Development

First off we'll need to do some pre deploy setup.  That's all detailed [here](https://github.com/oracle/oci-quickstart-prerequisites).

Note, the instructions below build a `.zip` file from you local copy for use in ORM.
If you want to not use ORM and deploy with the terraform CLI you need to rename
`provider.tf.cli -> provider.tf`. This is because authentication works slightly
differently in ORM vs the CLI. This file is ignored by the build process below.

Make sure you have terraform v0.14+ cli installed and accessible from your terminal.

### Build

Simply `build` your package and follow the [Resource Manager instructions](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/managingstacksandjobs.htm#console) for how to create a stack.  Prior to building the Stack, you may want to modify some parts of the deployment detailed below.

In order to `build` the zip file with the latest changes you made to this code, you can simply go to [build-orm](./build-orm) folder and use terraform to generate a new zip file:

At first time, you are required to initialize the terraform modules used by the template with  `terraform init` command:

```bash
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/archive...
- Installing hashicorp/archive v2.1.0...
- Installed hashicorp/archive v2.1.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Once terraform is initialized, just run `terraform apply` to generate ORM zip file.

```bash
$ terraform apply

data.archive_file.generate_zip: Refreshing state...

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

This command will package the content of `simple` folder into a zip and will store it in the `build-orm\dist` folder. You can check the content of the file by running `unzip -l dist/orm.zip`:

```bash
$ unzip -l dist/orm.zip
Archive:  dist/orm.zip

### Deploy

1. [Login](https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create) to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to import the stack
    > `Home > Solutions & Platform > Resource Manager > Stacks > Create Stack`

2. Upload the `orm.zip` and provide a name and description for the stack
![Create Stack](./images/create_orm_stack.png)

3. Configure the Stack. The UI will present the variables to the user dynamically, based on their selections. These are the configuration options:

> Compute Configuration

4. Click Next and Review the configuration.
5. Click Create button to confirm and create your ORM Stack.
6. On Stack Details page, you can now run `Terraform` commands to manage your infrastructure. You typically start with a plan then run apply to create and make changes to the infrastructure. More details below:

|      TERRAFORM ACTIONS     |           DESCRIPTION                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Plan                        | `terraform plan` is used to create an execution plan. This command is a convenient way to check the execution plan prior to make any changes to the infrastructure resources.|
|Apply                       | `terraform apply` is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration described by the template.|
|Destroy                     | `terraform destroy` is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.|

## Customize for Marketplace

In case you wanted to make changes to this template to use a Marketplace image rather than a platform image or custom image, you need to make the following changes.

1. Configure Marketplace listing variables on [`variables.tf`](./variables.tf).

|      VARIABLES             |           DESCRIPTION                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|mp_subscription_enabled     | Enable subscription to Marketplace.|
|mp_listing_id               | Marketplace App Catalog Listing OCID.|
|mp_listing_resource_id      | Marketplace Listing Image OCID.|
|mp_listing_resource_version | Marketplace Listing Package/Resource Version (Reference value)|

2. Modify [`compute.tf`](./compute.tf) set `source_details` to refer to `local.compute_image_id` rather than `platform_image_id`. The `local.compute_image_id` holds the logic to either refer to the marketplace image or a custom image, based on the `mp_subscription_enabled` flag.

```hcl
resource "oci_core_instance" "simple-vm" {
  availability_domain = local.availability_domain
  compartment_id      = var.compute_compartment_ocid
  display_name        = var.vm_display_name
  shape               = var.vm_compute_shape

  dynamic "shape_config" {
    for_each = local.is_flex_shape
      content {
        ocpus = shape_config.value
      }
  }


  create_vnic_details {
    subnet_id              = local.use_existing_network ? var.subnet_id : oci_core_subnet.simple_subnet[0].id
    display_name           = var.subnet_display_name
    assign_public_ip       = local.is_public_subnet
    hostname_label         = var.hostname_label
    skip_source_dest_check = false
    nsg_ids                = [oci_core_network_security_group.simple_nsg.id]
  }

  source_details {
    source_type = "image"
    #use a marketplace image or custom image:
    source_id   = local.compute_image_id
  }

```
2. Modify [`oci_images.tf`](./oci_images.tf) set `marketplace_source_images` map variable to refer to the marketplace images your Stack will launch.

```hcl

variable "marketplace_source_images" {
  type = map(object({
    ocid = string
    is_pricing_associated = bool
    compatible_shapes = list(string)
  }))
  default = {
    main_mktpl_image = {
      ocid = "ocid1.image.oc1..<unique_id>"
      is_pricing_associated = true
      compatible_shapes = []
    }
    #Remove comment and add as many marketplace images that your stack references be replicated to other realms
    #supporting_image = {
    #  ocid = "ocid1.image.oc1..<unique_id>"
    #  is_pricing_associated = false
    #  compatible_shapes = ["VM.Standard2.2", "VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro"]
    #}
  }
}

```

2. Run your tests using the Terraform CLI or build a new package and deploy on ORM.
